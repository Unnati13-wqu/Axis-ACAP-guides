# ACAP guides and examples
This repository serves as a collection of guides for ACAP development for Axis cameras by showing example code. Each explained problem and solution example has their own folder.

## Preuninstall script
This directory shows how the preuninstall script can be used to execute a script before the ACAP application is uninstalled from the camera.

## Parameter handler
This directory shows how the built in parameter library is used in SDK 3.

## Check glibc version
This is a simple application that prints the glibc version used in the camera and in the SDK. This is helpful for debugging and compatibility checking.
