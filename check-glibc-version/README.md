# Check glibc version

This is a simple app which prints a message to the standard output containing the glibc version in the runtime and the version it was compiled against.

To build the binary and run it, simply clone and run:
```
make run-bin
```

See the `Makefile` for options like camera IP, username, password, architecture, etc.
