# Parameter handler in ACAPs
This directory aims to clarify how parameter handling can be done in ACAP applications. The options differ depending on which SDK you use to build your application.

All Axis cameras comes with a built in parameter handler, in this are a lot of configuration options for the camera. Earlier SDKs also allowed third party applications to add their parameters to the camera's parameter handler. The parameter handler is available e.g. using the `param.cgi` VAPIX API or the `parhandclient` command using SSH. Many features has during the last few years been migrated to separate APIs instead of the parameter handler, this allows for better validation of values and synchronization of changes.

Another option for configuration handling in ACAPs is to bundle your own config handler and save the state to the persistent flash in the `localdata` directory. In this case, you need to create APIs and configuration interfaces yourself.

## SDK 3 and libaxparameter
In the older SDKs the `axparameter` library can be found. This is a helper library that allows you to interface with the cameras parameter handler using a C API. Using this API you can both read and write parameters and you can create new parameters.

When specifying a list of parameters and their types / allowed values in the `manifest.json` file (or the `param.conf`) file, these parameters will be created for the ACAP and an autogenerated configuration page will be created for the application in the cameras web UI. Where this configuration page is found depends on the version of the cameras web (decided by the firmware version).

The `SDK3` directory shows how the `axparameter` library can be used to get a configuration page in the "Application" tab of the Axis web UI.

## Parameter API in the ACAP Runtime
Note that this is stil in Beta release and might be changed.

The "ACAP Runtime" is an application that can be installed in the cameras. One of the many things it can do is to act as a proxy to access the cameras parameters from other applications using a gRPC protocol (which is supported in many languages). Also note that this API only gives you read access to the parameters, you cannot use it to create your own parameters for your application.

Axis describes the [ACAP Runtime here](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-runtime) and have examples on reading parameters with it from [Python](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples/tree/main/parameter-api-python) and from [C++](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples/tree/main/parameter-api-cpp).
